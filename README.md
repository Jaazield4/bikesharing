During the month of August we can see that the peak hours come at 6 and 7 pm. There is also a spike at 7:00 a.m. Giving that the majority of people work a tradition 8-5 job, many of these 7:00 a.m. users could be using citibike as their main source of transportation to and from work. We can also see the only times that there were less than 10k rides during the month of August came between the hours of 1:00-4:00 a.m.

From the above image we can see where the majority of users are deciding to first pick up and use their citibike. As we can see there is a lot more in the Manhattan area as oposed to other areas. This could be due to the large number of tourists that populate the area as well as the amount of traffic typically seen in this part of the city.
